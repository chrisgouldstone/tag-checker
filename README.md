# Tag Checker
This node cli tool allows you to check if the passed string has valid opening and closing tags and valid tag nesting. 

## Usage

1. install packages
2. run build script in package.json
3. `node ./dist/tagCheck.js <H>this is in a H tag</H>`

## Known issues

* Invalid tag messages are not quite correct and a little misleading
